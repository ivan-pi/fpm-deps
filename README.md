# fpmdeps

Generate dependency graphs of fpm projects

To start using `fpmdeps` run the commands:

```
> git clone ... && cd fpmdeps   # clone project
> fpm install --prefix ~/.local    # install in directory on the user PATH
> fpmdeps  # run fpmdeps in the root directory of an fpm project
```

The result can be piped to the Graphviz [`dot`](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/command.html) command, e.g.:

```
> fpmdeps |Â -Tsvg -ofpmdeps.svg
```
resulting in

![fpmdeps package dependency graph](./fpmdeps.svg)
