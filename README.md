# fpm-deps

Generate dependency graphs of fpm projects

To start using `fpm-deps` run the commands:

```
> git clone https://github.com/ivan-pi/fpm-deps && cd fpm-deps   # clone project
> fpm install --prefix ~/.local   # install in directory on the user PATH
> fpm-deps   # run fpm-deps in the root directory of an fpm project
```

The result can be piped to the Graphviz [`dot`](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/command.html) command, e.g.:

```
> fpm-deps |Â dot -Tsvg -ofpmdeps.svg
```
resulting in

![fpmdeps package dependency graph](./fpmdeps.svg)
